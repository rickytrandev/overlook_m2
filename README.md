# Background and Description:
The Overlook Hotel Management Tool is a project aimed at building a comprehensive tool for hotel customers and staff to efficiently manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. The project involves the use of object and array prototype methods for data manipulation, creating a user-friendly interface, making network requests to retrieve data, implementing a testing suite using Test-Driven Development (TDD), and ensuring code reusability and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

# Goals and Objectives:
Utilize object and array prototype methods for data manipulation.
Create a clear and accessible user interface for both customers and staff.
Make network requests using the Fetch API to retrieve and add data.
Implement a robust testing suite using Mocha and Chai, following Test-Driven Development.
Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), reusable code that adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

# Requirements
- Collaborative workflow using Pull Requests (PRs) with accountabilibuddy.
- Use of Fetch API for data retrieval and addition.
- Testing with Mocha and Chai.
- Initial setup using the provided Webpack Starter Kit repo.
- Use of a local server with specified endpoints for data operations.
- Build with accessibility in mind, using ARIA and tools to test accessibility.

# Technologies
